# **Zoro Workout Tracker**

Welcome to Zoro's Workout Tracker!


## Description

Zoro is such a manly muscular man, he requires a super manly workout tracker to track his exercises to build those manly muscles.

### **Tasks completed**

Created a workout tracker using node.js and monogodb

## User Story

```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

## Business Context

A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

```The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
